# React Battleship Game

> From The Odin Project's [curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/javascript/lessons/battleship)

This project is a complete rebuild of the [classic battleship game](http://en.battleship-game.org/) using React, test-driven development and object-oriented programming.

- The project is built using test-driven development, writing unit tests in Jest
- The game logic was written in an object-oriented programming style with ship, gameboard, player and computer objects
- The game state is managed by React Hooks
- The UI elements are from the Ant Design React Component library
- The gameboard, cells and ships are built using CSS and styled components
